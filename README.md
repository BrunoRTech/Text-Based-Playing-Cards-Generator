# Playing Cards Generator (Text Based)

This project is a **text-based playing cards generator**, created using the guide provided by [Coddy.tech](https://coddy.tech/courses/playing_cards_generator_text_based). It demonstrates how to dynamically generate playing cards using **Python**, applying structured text formatting to visually represent different card ranks and suits.

## Features
- **Dynamic Card Generation**: Creates text-based playing cards with varying ranks and suits.
- **Symbol Mapping**: Converts numerical values into traditional card symbols (A, J, Q, K).
- **Unicode Suits**: Uses Unicode characters for club, diamond, heart, and spade suits.
- **Formatted Output**: Displays cards in a structured, easy-to-read format.

## File Structure
- **main.py**: Contains the Python script that generates and prints playing cards.

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
3. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Customization
If you'd like to modify the card generator:
- **Adjust Rank Mapping**: Modify the `rank_symbols` dictionary to customize rank representations.
- **Change Suit Symbols**: Update the `suit_symbols` dictionary to use alternative suit representations.
- **Modify Layout**: Adjust the `printCards()` function to format the cards differently.
